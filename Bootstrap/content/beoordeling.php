                                out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now.
                                We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the
                                other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but

                                standards I did, then some kid with a nail 
                                showed me I was living in his world, a world 
                                where chaos rules not order, a world where 
                                righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's 
                                world, and if you're not willing to play by his 
                                rules, then you're gonna have to pay the price.
