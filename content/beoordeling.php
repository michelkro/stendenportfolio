                                us survived the slide... and only five made it 
                                out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now.
                                We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the
                                other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but 
                                it doesn't hold a candle to man.

                                standards I did, then some kid with a nail 
                                showed me I was living in his world, a world 
                                where chaos rules not order, a world where 
                                righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's 
                                world, and if you're not willing to play by his 
                                rules, then you're gonna have to pay the price.
